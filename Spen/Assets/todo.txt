World:
	- Object Generation
	- World Tiers
	- Chunk Loading


ridged multifractal noise - underground layer cave gen
final object generation pass
storage? - either just saved modified chunks or save changes and rebuild generation


Notes on the way the world works:
- Primary world tier is the outside overworld
	Tile maps make up the layers of this world i.e. base tiles, object tiles e.t.c
- Other world tiers exist: indoors, underground
**Options:
	New scene for each tier (i like this? Make more pieces)
	Player inventory and other stats need to persist through scene loads so save then load
